# Exam Topical Compiler

In our project, we had attempted to embark on an AI-based task where examination questions from various colleges would be categorised by the AI model based on their corresponding topics. Thus far, we have not much made headway except for converting the Mathtype objects into text form for readability by the AI. In this respository, we share one sample of how these text files look like. (Due to sensitivity of the material, we are sharing only one question for illustration purposes.)
